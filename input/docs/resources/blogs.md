>  The effort to learn Rx and ReactiveUI is worth the trouble. My claim is based on this notion that ReactiveUI shines as complexity increases, but also on my belief that most people underestimate the complexity of their app. If you disagree that most of your code is reacting to something that changed, you might be underestimating the complexity of your app. - Creator of [SQLitePCL.raw](https://github.com/ericsink/SQLitePCL.raw)

>  It took me over 4 slow years to realize that the Reactive Extensions (RX) is a good idea. It’s never too late to start learning something new. Here’s a few reasons why I personally dived into RX. The influencers have double downed on the library, Google has moved to a RX mindset with their new Architecture Components and other languages/frameworks have implementations - Thus the knowledge is universal.
