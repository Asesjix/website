* Built-In Navigation Containers
* Custom Navigation Containers
* Multiple Navigation Containers
* Multiple Navigation Stacks
-FreshMvvm works different to Prism in regards to Navigation in that you control over the Navigation while prism makes the decisions for you, so Prism is easier but less flexible.
