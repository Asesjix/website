At Microsoft Build Live today, Microsoft [shared a first look at their plans](
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/05/07/net-core-3-and-support-for-windows-desktop-applications/
) for .NET Core 3. The highlight of .NET Core 3 is support for Windows desktop applications, specifically Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Framework (WPF), and UWP XAML. Soon you will be able to run new and existing Windows desktop applications on .NET Core and enjoy all the benefits that .NET Core has to offer.

ReactiveUI had some heads up that was coming and added `netcoreapp20` as a supported platform as part of [the release of v8.0.0 last week](https://reactiveui.net/blog/2018/05/reactiveui-v8.0.0-released). When `netcoreapp30` lands ReactiveUI fully intends to support these scenarios. It's unclear at this stage if it means that WPF/WinForms will be able to run on other platforms - I seriously doubt it as it would be a massive undertaking but if Microsoft does it - ReactiveUI will support it. 

If you need to ship cross-platform applications on .NET core right now then the maintainers of ReactiveUI recommned that you check out [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia). Their community is as active and vibrant as ours, open by default and [you can drop in for a chat](https://gitter.im/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).

If you want to get a head start on .NET Core 3.0 and want to he make it possible sooner - send in a PR that üö¢'s this:
