Announcing something pretty special today; I'm not sure if anyone has done this before so here we go. ReactiveUI runs a <a href="https://reactiveui.net/meetup">virtual meetup</a> and is always looking opportunities to teach the ways of programming in a reactive manner. The meetup is a little different because we are global first; with attendees connecting in from all around the world from different time zones. We would be happy to schedule our meetup when your meetup is on and dial in via Zoom even if it's 2am for the presenter.
