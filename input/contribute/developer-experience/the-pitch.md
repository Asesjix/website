We are building something amazing; reactive programming changes you as a developer and makes you better. Knowledge of reactive programming is _universal across programming languages_.

Case in point - AngularJS was released, people adopted it, and then Version v2.0 (cough 4.0) came out. All that accumulated knowledge - disposed of. Such a waste.

Internally the we debate whether ReactiveUI is or is not a framework, as at its core the project is essentially a bunch of extension methods for the Reactive Extensions.

If you are sick of investing personal development energy in transitory frameworks whereby you must learn "how do I do $x with $framework specific way" knowing deep down in side that this knowledge has no value in the future; then please come and join us over at https://reactiveui.net/slack
