# The Pitch

We are building something amazing; reactive programming changes you as a developer and makes you better. Knowledge of reactive programming is _universal across programming languages_.

Case in point - AngularJS was released, people adopted it, and then Version v2.0 (cough 4.0) came out. All that accumulated knowledge - disposed of. Such a waste.

Internally the we debate whether ReactiveUI is or is not a framework, as at its core the project is essentially a bunch of extension methods for the Reactive Extensions.

If you are sick of investing personal development energy in transitory frameworks whereby you must learn "how do I do $x with $framework specific way" knowing deep down in side that this knowledge has no value in the future; then please come and join us over at https://reactiveui.net/slack

# The Plan (tm)

ReactiveUI is the father of the extremely popular ReactiveCocoa AKA "RAC" (and also by extension ReactiveSwift) which literaly transformed and changed the way iOS software development is done. Whilst Paul was working at GitHub, the team behind ReactiveCocoa (also GitHub employees) ported the concepts behind ReactiveUI to iOS via much beer and coffee  :-)

IMHO (Geoff here) the .NET ecosystem is behind the eightball with reactive programming _even though we are the ecosystem that invented the reactive extensions_. This is super embarassing. Alot has changed in the nine years since the birth of the Reactive Extensions, there's been huge growth in the Javascript community (all angular developers, now must know reactive programming), Scala (server-side; play framework) and in partical the (Java "native") Android Mobile commuinity have turned to the reactive extnensions to help cope with the complexity of Android development. 

Why? It's cause the the developer experience (documentation, samples, people presenting and sharing their experiences at meetups) has been lacking. Let's fix this.

See https://reactivex.slack.com/archives/C02AJB872/p1502462627603705 for some ideas on how to fix this, head on over to https://reactiveui.net/slack for an invite if you don't have access.

# Help Wanted

Read the plan first.

This page needs fleshing out, pretty much every interaction we have. If you have questions PR the answers here. It's the onboarding guide for other people who may wish to help with documentation:

https://reactiveui.net/contribute/developer-experience/

That page is really for _the maintainers_ (not the users) it's so maintainers/contributors don't burn out.

As of a couple days ago have a gramatical guide and writing style guide. Personally I've always been a big fan of mailchimp. They open sourced their guide so ours is based off theirs. It's theirs as a baseline and we can change it as need be.

See https://reactiveui.net/contribute/content-style-guide/writing-for-social-media#engagement as example for customization that's happening.

I'm 90% happy with the navigation structure but it definately could be improved. Right now we are kinda dumping information in there without much thought to the content/style-guide for writing (aka editing) with the view-point that someone could take A and B, output C with a little guidance. This is the first time I've ever documented an OSS project on this scale before. If you have ideas, let's do them.
